### 👋hey! I'm Mathurah (she/her)

I'm a Systems Design Engineering student from the University of Waterloo, passionate about design, data, and building sustainable systems. I love tinkering with things on the web and you can see some of my projects on my GitHub, or learn more about me on my website - www.mathurahravigulan.com.


## what I'm working on
Currently on my school term and I'm fostering Waterloo's tech mentorship community and hosting a podcast on the side. I'm an incoming UX developer @Shopify this Fall and am looking for product-facing roles for Summer 2021. 🥳
