### ðŸ‘‹hey! I'm Mathurah (she/her)

I'm a Systems Design Engineering student from the University of Waterloo, passionate about design, data, and building sustainable systems. I love tinkering with things on the web and you can see some of my projects on my GitHub, or learn more about me on my website - www.mathurah.tech.

I've worked at Deloitte & Shopify as a software developer and am currently working at Microsoft as PM intern. I'm currently looking for Winter 2022 internship opportunities in software or product! Feel free to shoot me an email for my resume: mathurah.ravigulan@gmail.com
